# Route and Fuel Stop API

This project is an API that calculates the optimal route between a start and finish location within the USA, providing fuel stop recommendations along the way based on the most cost-effective fuel prices. It assumes the vehicle has a maximum range of 500 miles and achieves 10 miles per gallon. The API also returns the total cost of fuel based on the calculated route.

## Features

- **Route Calculation**: Computes the best driving route between a start and finish location using the OpenRouteService API.
- **Fuel Stops**: Suggests fuel stations along the route based on the most cost-effective prices found in a CSV file of fuel prices.
- **Total Fuel Cost**: Calculates the total cost of fuel based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency and route distance.
- **Route Map**: Provides a URL to view the route on a map.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- OpenRouteService API Key (You can obtain it from [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/))
- A CSV file containing fuel price data (`fuel-prices-for-be-assessment.csv`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Add your OpenRouteService API key to your Django settings:
    ```python
    OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY = '<your-api-key>'
    ```

4. Ensure that the `fuel-prices-for-be-assessment.csv` file is placed in the `data/` folder inside your project directory.
