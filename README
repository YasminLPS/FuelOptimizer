Route and Fuel Stop API

This project is an API that calculates the optimal route between a start and finish location within the USA, providing fuel stop recommendations along the way based on the most cost-effective fuel prices. It assumes the vehicle has a maximum range of 500 miles and achieves 10 miles per gallon. The API also returns the total cost of fuel based on the calculated route.
Features

    Route Calculation: Computes the best driving route between a start and finish location using the OpenRouteService API.
    Fuel Stops: Suggests fuel stations along the route based on the most cost-effective prices found in a CSV file of fuel prices.
    Total Fuel Cost: Calculates the total cost of fuel based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency and route distance.
    Route Map: Provides a URL to view the route on a map.
